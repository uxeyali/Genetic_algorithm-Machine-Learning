# Genetic_algorithm-Machine-Learning
I wrote a program that finds the optimum solution to a mathematical function. We can replace the function with
 any function of our choosing, and it will work.
 
 I wrote the program in Python and I made it so that we can set the generations, the number of chromosomes etc. as a parameter so we can adjust the algorithm to work the way we want.
Please feel free to use this algorithm for your own purposes and to improve it.
